# Notes on Graphs 
### (Breadth and Depth first searching)

## Structure

I. "nodes" are verticies {v}

II. Edges connect verticies {e}

III. Two verticies conneceted directly by edge are **adjacent**.

**Note:** See Notes on Mar28-2016 for more on how to create graphs.

## Code Structure

### Adjacency List

| Vertext | Adjacent |
|---------|----------|
|name | vertext *v |
|adjacent[] ||
|visted||

## Searching a Graph

I. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Search accross the graph, and then search deeper
  * Across - The first level of adjacent verticies

II. Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Search deep in the graph before going across


## Searching Algorithims

### Breadth-First Search

I. Gives the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
* This can be achieved using a queue
```c++
vertex = search(value);
vertex->visted = TRUE;
vertex->distance = 0;
Queue->enqueue(vertex);
while(Queue != empty)
{
	n = Queue->dequeue();
	for(int x = 0; 0 < n->adjacent->end(); x++)
	{
		if(!n->adjacent[x]->v->visted) // Looks at the adjacent nodes
		{
			n->adjacent[x]->v->visted = TRUE;
			n->adjacent[x]->v->distance = n->distance + 1;
			PRINT n->adjacent[x]->v->name;
			Queue->enqueue(n->adjacent[x]->v);
		}
	}
}
```
