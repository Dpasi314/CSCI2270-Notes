# Red-Black Tree Delete
```
        7
      /   \
     2     11
    / \   /  \
   1   5 8    14
      /        \
     4          15
```
### Deleting the 2
I. The 2 is replaced with the 4, both are red nodes so there is an equal number of black nodes

###
```
        14
      /   \
     2    15
    / \     
   1   11 
      
```

### Deleting the 2
I. Replace 2 with the 11

II. **Violations**:
  * i. Red parent has a red child
  * ii. Changed number of black nodes in left subtree

III. **Solution**:
  * i. Recolor the 11 to be BLACK

## Deleting a node from a Red-Black Tree
I. same as deleting from a BST

II. 0,1,2 children

III. Store the color of the deletes node, and the repalcement node.

IV. Do reblanacing if the delete node is **BLACK**

```c++
delete(value)
	node = search(value) // Find the value to delete
	nodeColor = node->color; // Color of the node to delete
	
	// Zero Children
	// replace with nullNode

	// One Child
	// Replace with the left or right child (The one that it has)
	
	// Two children
	min = minimum(node->right); // Find the minimum value of the right subtree
	nodeColor = min->color; // Color of the replacement node
	x = min->right;

	// Everything to color is the same as BST delete
	if(min == node->rightChild)
		node->left = min;
		min->parent = node->parent;
	else
		// replace min with minimum
	
	min->color = node->color;

	if(nodeColor == BLACK)
		RedBlackBalance(x);
	
```

## Red Black Balancing
```c++
RedBlackBalance(x)
	// Need to know the color of X siblings
	// Case 1 - sibling is red
	// Case 2 - LeftChild, rightChild are black (of the sibling)
	// Case 3 - leftChild is red, and rightChild is Black
		// case 3 - Sibling HAS to be black in the case leftChild is red
	// Case 4 - Everything else
	while(x != root)
	{
		if(x == x->parent->leftChild)
		{
			sibling = x->parent->rightChild;
			if(sibling->color == RED)
			{
				sibling->color = BLACK;
				sibling->parent->color = RED;
				leftRotate(x->parent);
				sibling = x->parent->rightChild;
			}
			if(sibling->leftChild->color == BLACK && sibling->rightChild->color = BLACK)
			{
				sibling->color = RED;
				x = x->parent;
			}	
			else if(sibling->leftColor == RED && sibling->rightColor == BLACK)
			{
				sibling->leftChilt->color = BLACK;
				sibling->color = RED;
				rightRotate(sibling);
				sibling = x->parent->right;				
			}
			else
			{
				sibling->color = x->parent->color;
				x->parent->color = BLACK;
				sibling->right->color = BLACK;
				leftRotate(x->parent);
				 x = root;
			}	
		}
		x->color = BLACK;

	}

```
