# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## What is it?

I. Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph where weights are non-negative

### Example
```c++

          [150]
  A  -------------- B
   \                 \ 
    \ [40]            \ [200]
     \   [50]     [10] \ 
      F ------- E ----- G
       \       /
   [40] \     / [40]
         \   /
           H

```

* Path A to G
  * A-F-E-G is the most cost efficient path, this is a solution

#### How it Works
* Start at A, goal is G
* B = 150, F = 40
  * Select F (40) and mark as solved

* E = 90 (Cost of A to F, and then F to E)
* H = 80 (Cost of A to F and then F to H)
  * Selects H, marks as solved
* Select E and mark as solved (Cost of 90)
* G = 100, B = 150
* Select G, this is goal so finished.
* G - E - F - A is the shortest path (Cost of 100)
