# Red Black Trees
## Insert
  I. New node is red

  II. **Violation:** red node has a red parent

## Case I
  I. The *uncle* node is red

## Case II
  I. The new node is a right child (uncle is black)

### Resolving Case II
```c++
x = x->parent;
leftRotate(x) // convert case II.to case 3
```

## Case III
  I. The new node is a left child (uncle is black)

### Resolving Case III
  I. Recolor x->parent and x->parent->parent

  II. Right rotation on x->parent->parent

  III. Recolor

  IV. Right rotate

## Algorithims for Red-Black Inserts
```c++
redBlackInsert(Object value)
	x = insert(value) // Find place in BST for new node

	while(x != root && x->pparent->color != RED)
		if(x->parent == x->parent->parent->left)
			uncle = x->parent->parent->right;

			if(uncle->color == RED)
				x->parent->color = BLACK;
				uncle->color = BLACK;
				x->parent->parent->color = RED;
				x = x->parent->parent;

			else // Uncle is BLACK
				if(x == x->parent->right) // X is a right child
					x = x->parent;
					leftRotate(x); // Makes X a left child, case III

				x->parent->color = BLACK;
				x->parent->parent->color = RED;
				rightRotate(x->parent->parent);

		else // x->parent is a right child, switch left and right rotations
```

## Example
  I. Is the root

  II. Items: 2, 5, 8, 4, 15 are RED

  III. Add 4
```
          11
        /    \
       2      14
      / \      \
     1   7      15
        / \
       5   8  
      /
     4
```
  IV. Recolor 5 to BLACK

  V. Recolor 8 to BLACK

  VI. Recolor 7 to RED


#### Things to Note
 * I. Item 2, 4, 15 are stil BLACK

 * II. Item 7 is now RED

  VII. The Uncle (14) is BLACK
  
### Tree after left roation
```
          11
        /    \
       7      14
      / \      \
     2   8      15
    /  \
   1    5
       /
      4
```

 VIII. 7 is BLACK
   IX. 11 is RED
    X. rightRotate on 11

### Tree after right rotation
```
           7
         /    \
       2      11
      / \    /  \
     1   5  8   14
        /        \
       4          15

```
#### Things to Note
  * I. Items 2, 11, 15, and 4 are RED, everything else is black
