# Red Black Trees
## Insert
  I. New node is red

  II. **Violation:** red node has a red parent

## Case I
  I. The *uncle* node is red

## Case II
  I. The new node is a right child (uncle is black)

### Resolving Case II
```c++
x = x->parent;
leftRotate(x) // convert case II.to case 3
```

## Case III
  I. The new node is a left child (uncle is black)

### Resolving Case III
  I. Recolor x->parent and x->parent->parent

  II. Right rotation on x->parent->parent

  III. Recolor

  IV. Right rotate

## Algorithims for Red-Black Inserts
```c++
redBlackInsert(Object value)
	x = insert(value) // Find place in BST for new node
	while(x != root && x->pparent->color != RED)
		if(x->parent == x->parent->parent->left)
			uncle = x->parent->parent->right;
			if(uncle->color == RED)
				x->parent->color = BLACK;
				uncle->color = BLACK;
				x->parent->parent->color = RED;
				x = x->parent->parent;
			else // Uncle is BLACK
				if(x == x->parent->right) // X is a right child
					x = x->parent;
					leftRotate(x); // Makes X a left child, case III
					x->parent->color = BLACK;
					x->parent->parent->color = RED;
					rightRotate(x->parent->parent);
					
						


		else // x->parent is a right child

```
