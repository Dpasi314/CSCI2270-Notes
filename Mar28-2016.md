# Notes on Graphs and N-ary Trees

## N-Ary Trees

I. Child ordering makes search more difficult.

II. Search - Need to search through the entire tree.

III. Dynamic structure - Not fixed number of children
	
* Created conventionally using a _Vector_
* Parent has link to left child
* Children have links to siblings

## Graphs

I. (_informally_)  a visual structure

II. Graph G - {V, E}

* V is a set of _verticies_
  * Each point on the graph
* E is a set of _edges_ 
  * Lines connecting the verticies
