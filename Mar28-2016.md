# Notes on Graphs and N-ary Trees

## N-Ary Trees

I. Child ordering makes search more difficult.

II. Search - Need to search through the entire tree.

III. Dynamic structure - Not fixed number of children
* Created conventionally using a _Vector_
* Parent has link to left child
* Children have links to siblings

## Graphs

I. (_informally_)  a visual structure

II. Graph G - {V, E}
* V is a set of _verticies_
  * Each point on the graph
* E is a set of _edges_ 
  * Lines connecting the verticies

### Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs

I. The Difference
* **Un**weighted Graphs: edge weights are all 1
* Weighted Graphs: assign a numerical value to the edge
  * Distance between any 2 vertecies has a value greater than 1

### Directed vs. Undirected

I. The Difference
* **Un**directed Graphs: edge goes in both directions
* Directed Graphs: Edge goes in only one direction

## Building a Graph

### Building Methods
```c++ 

                       --> Lincoln {V3}
                      /           \
      Denver{V1} --------          \
	|             \            Omaha {V4}
	v              ----> Witchita {V5}  
     Colo. Springs {V2}
```

I. Adjacency Matrix
* 2D Matrix of Connections
  * Unweighted Graphs - 1 if there is a connection, 0 if no connection
  * Weighted Graphs - Weight is edge, -1 if no edge

#### Building using an Adjacency Matrix

I. List out all {V} in the graph
 
```c++
     {V1} {V2} {V3} {V4} {V5}
     ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ 
{V1}| 0    1    1    0    1
{V2}| 1    0    0    0    0
{V3}| 1    0    0    1    0
{V4}| 0    0    1    0    0
{v5}| 1    0    0    0    0
_
```
II. Adjacency List
* More efficent than the matrix
* Store a list of edges for each vertex

#### Building using an Adjacency List
```c++
Denver -> {Colo. Springs, Lincoln, Witchita}
Colo Springs -> {Den}
Lincoln -> {Denver, Omaha}
Omaha -> {Lincoln}
Witchita -> {Denver}
```
* Verticies are linked lists or array or vectord
* **Note**: Adjacent means directly connect
