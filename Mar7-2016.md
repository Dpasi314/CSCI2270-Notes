# Notes on Red and Black Trees
## Tree Balancing
I.The height of the left differs from the height of the right by no mare than 1

II. To acomplish the balancing, build the BST as a "Red Black Tree"
	
## Building the BST as a Red-Black tree
  
### The Setup

I. Roughly height balanced (+-1)

II. Where no path is more than 2x the length of another path to the bottom of the tree.
    
III. Each node has:
  * I. A color, a key, left, right, parent values.
  
     * i. This color is either Red or Black

IV. Change in how leaf nodes are handled:

V. Create and empty node, not nullptr! with same properties as the other nodes in the tree. 
	
## Properties of a Red-Black tree:
I. The Node is either RED or BLACK

II. The root is BLACK

III. Every "Null Node" is BLACK
  
VI. If the node is RED both of its children must be BLACK

V. For each node in the tree, all paths from node to leaf nodes contain the same number of BLACK nodes

```c++

          10 [X]
         /  \
    [A]5   22 [Y]
           /  \
      [B] 20 [ 25    ]
              [  \   ] [C]
              [   26 ]
```

## Left and Right Rotations
### Left Rotation:
```c++	
          Y
         / \
       X    C
      / \
     A   B

```
### Right Rotation:
```c++
          X
         / \
        A   Y
           / \
          B   C

```
## Right Rotate Algorithim:
```c++
TreeNode * rotateRight(TreeNode * x, TreeNode * root)
    {
        TreeNode * y = x->leftChild;
        x->leftChild = y->rightChild;
        
        
        if(y->rightChild != NULL)
            y->rightChild->parent = x;
        
        y->parent = x->parent;
        
        if(x->parent == NULL)
            root = y;
        else if(x == x->parent->rightChild)
            x->parent->leftChild = y;
        else
            x->parent->rightChild = y;
        
        y->rightChild = x;
        x->parent = y;
        
        return y;
    }
```
## Left Rotate Algorithim
```c++
    TreeNode * rotateLeft(TreeNode * x, TreeNode * root)
    {
        TreeNode * y = x->rightChild;
        x->rightChild = y->leftChild;
        
        
        if(y->leftChild != NULL)
            y->leftChild->parent = x;
        
        y->parent = x->parent;
        
        if(x->parent == NULL)
            root = y;
        else if(x == x->parent->leftChild)
            x->parent->leftChild = y;
        else
            x->parent->rightChild = y;
        
        y->leftChild = x;
        x->parent = y;
        
        return y;
    }
```
## Insert Nodes

I. Use the nullNode for the leaf nodes instead of setting the chiildren to nullptr;

II. Set the color of the new nodes to RED (Everytime add to tree, node is RED)

III. Balance

I.Violations:
	
  * i. Root is BLACK

  * ii. Children of a RED node must be BLACK
	

### Adding a New node:
  I. Case 1: The uncle is RED
     Solution: Recolor parent and uncle to be BLACK, recolor parent's parent to be RED
